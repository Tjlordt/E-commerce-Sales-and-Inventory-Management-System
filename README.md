# E-commerce-Sales-and-Inventory-Management-System
The code generates a comprehensive database for an E-commerce Sales and Inventory Management System with realistic and sensible data. The system comprises tables for products, sales orders, order details, customers, inventory, and employees.
Certainly! In the context of databases, a schema refers to the structure or blueprint that defines how data is organized and how relationships among data elements are handled. The schema defines the logical view of the entire database.
The database schema consists of several interconnected tables:

Products Table:

ProductID: Unique identifier for each product.
ProductName: Name of the product.
ProductRating: Categorical variable representing product ratings (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent).
ProductWeight(g): Numeric variable indicating the weight of the product in grams.
ProductPrice: Numeric variable representing the price of the product.
ProductCategory: Categorical variable for product categories (Electronics, Clothing, Home Appliances).
ProductColor: Categorical variable for product colors (Red, Blue, Green).
Sales Orders Table:

SalesOrderID: Unique identifier for each sales order.
OrderDate: Date when the sales order was placed.
CustomerID: Identifier for the customer placing the order.
Order Details Table:

OrderID: Identifier linking the order detail to a specific sales order.
ProductID: Identifier linking the order detail to a specific product.
Quantity: Numeric variable representing the quantity of the product in the order.
Customers Table:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
CustomerName: Name of the customer.
Email: Unique identifier for each customer (Email address of the customer).
PhoneNumber: Unique identifier for each customer (Contact number of the customer).
Inventory Table:

ProductID: Identifier linking the inventory to a specific product.
QuantityInStock: Numeric variable representing the quantity of the product in stock.
Employees Table:

EmployeeID: Unique identifier for each employee.
EmployeeName: Name of the employee.
Role: Categorical variable representing the role of the employee (Manager, Salesperson, Technician).
This schema establishes relationships between products, sales orders, customers, inventory, and employees, creating a comprehensive structure for managing e-commerce data.
Key Concepts:

Primary Key: A unique identifier for each record in a table.
Foreign Key: A field in a table that is a primary key in another table, establishing a link between them.
Relationships: Define how tables are related; for example, a one-to-many relationship between Customers and Orders.
Indexes: Optimize data retrieval by creating pointers to the location of the data.
Constraints: Rules defined on data, such as NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and CHECK.
Views: Virtual tables based on SELECT query results.
Stored Procedures and Triggers: Additional functionalities using precompiled SQL statements and actions triggered by events.


 Below are simplified SQL commands illustrating the relationships between the tables based on the provided schema and also These queries demonstrate the relationships between the tables through JOIN operations, linking tables based on their foreign key and primary key relationships.
(1) 
In summary, the code retrieves information about the top 8 products with the highest quantity in stock by performing an inner join between the "products" and "inventory" tables and ordering the result set accordingly.
SELECT *
FROM products
INNER JOIN inventory ON products.ProductID = inventory.ProductID
ORDER BY inventory.QuantityInStock DESC
LIMIT 8
(2)
SELECT *
FROM sales_orders
INNER JOIN order_details ON sales_orders.SalesOrderID = order_details.OrderID
INNER JOIN products ON order_details.ProductID = products.ProductID
LIMIT 8;

This SQL code pulls together information from three tables: sales_orders, order_details, and products, to show details about the first 8 sales orders. It gives specifics about each order, like how many products were bought and details about those productsâ€”such as their names, ratings, weights, prices, categories, and colors. By focusing on the initial 8 orders, the query gives a quick look at what products were sold and their details in the early days of the sales system.It's like peeking at the first few pages of a sales diary to understand what started at the beginning
(3)
SELECT *
FROM customers
INNER JOIN sales_orders ON customers.CustomerID = sales_orders.CustomerID
LIMIT 6
The SQL query is designed to link each sales order with its corresponding customer, providing a consolidated view of customer-related sales transactions. It achieves this by combining relevant columns from the 'customers' and 'sales_orders' tables through an inner join based on the shared 'CustomerID.' The result is a concise output displaying details about customers and their associated sales orders. The use of 'LIMIT 6' ensures that only the initial six rows of this combined information are presented, facilitating a focused preview of the data.
(4)

SELECT *
FROM employees
INNER JOIN sales_orders ON employees.EmployeeID = sales_orders.EmployeeID
LIMIT 8;
This SQL query retrieves information by performing an INNER JOIN between the 'employees' and 'sales_orders' tables based on matching 'EmployeeID' values. It selects all columns from the result set, providing details about employees and their associated sales orders. The LIMIT clause restricts the output to the first 4 rows, offering a concise view of employee-sales order associations. This query helps in examining a small subset of data for quick analysis
(5)
SELECT products.ProductID, products.ProductName, inventory.QuantityInStock
FROM products
JOIN inventory ON products.ProductID = inventory.ProductID
WHERE inventory.QuantityInStock < 10
LIMIT 8;
This SQL query extracts vital product information, specifically focusing on ProductID, ProductName, and QuantityInStock. The JOIN operation harmonizes data from the 'products' and 'inventory' tables based on matching 'ProductID' values. The WHERE clause acts as a filter, spotlighting products with a QuantityInStock of less than 10. The concluding LIMIT 8 ensures a concise result set, emphasizing the first eight entries that meet the criteria. This query effectively unveils products facing potential stock shortages, providing valuable insights for inventory management.
(6)
SELECT c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName, SUM(p.ProductPrice * od.Quantity) AS TotalAmountSpent
FROM customers c
JOIN sales_orders so ON c.CustomerID = so.CustomerID
JOIN order_details od ON so.SalesOrderID = od.OrderID
JOIN products p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName
ORDER BY TotalAmountSpent DESC
LIMIT 5;
The query identifies the top 5 customers based on their total spending. It achieves this by combining information from the 'customers,' 'sales_orders,' 'order_details,' and 'products' tables. The results are grouped by CustomerID and CustomerName, and the total amount spent by each customer is calculated using the product price and quantity ordered. The final output is then ordered in descending order based on the total amount spent, and the result is limited to the top 5 customers. In essence, this query provides a concise overview of the highest-spending customers in terms of total product purchases.
(7)
SELECT *
FROM inventory
WHERE QuantityInStock > 50
LIMIT 8
This SQL query extracts details about products in the inventory with a quantity exceeding 50 units. By selecting all columns from the 'inventory' table, filtering for items where the 'QuantityInStock' surpasses 50, and limiting the results to the first 8 rows, the query offers a concise overview of well-stocked products in the inventory.
(8)SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE ProductRating = 'Good'
LIMIT 8;
The query retrieves detailed information about products with a 'Good' rating from the products table, presenting up to 8 rows that meet the specified condition. This type of query is beneficial for extracting specific data subsets when dealing with large datasets
